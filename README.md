This is a script for the Adafruit Feather Huzzah with the Featherwing OLED display. It will scan and display all available wifi networks.

After uploading the sketch the buttons on the Adafruit FeatherWing will allow you to initiate a scan of the surrounding networks as well as scroll through the results. The buttons map as follows but can be modified in the script.

> Button A -> PAGE UP
> 
> Button B -> SCAN
> 
> Button C -> PAGE DOWN

Each page for the networks will display the following information about the network:

> Network number / All networks
> 
> SSID
> 
> Signal Strength
> 
> Network Visibility (v: visible, h: hidden)
> 
> Wifi Channel
>
